### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an enthusiast data scientist and software developer working at the intersection of Tech, Media and Business. I've opened up this profile to share some of the works I do as part of my nerdiness. The excercises are mostly data problems I pulled from my classes at MIT and from Kaggle, solved using Python.

Hope y'all have fun getting 'in the zone' with me while trying to solve these data and software riddles!
